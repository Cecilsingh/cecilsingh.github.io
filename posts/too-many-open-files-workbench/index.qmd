### Problem

You may see errors in logs similar to the below when using Posit Workbench:
```default
[rsession-<username>] ERROR system error 24 (Too many open files)
```


### Solution

It's a good idea to use a command like *lsof* to check and see what processes are currently using a large number of file descriptors. Alternatively, we can increase the limit on the number of open files for the affected user.

To do so, you will need to modify your */etc/rstudio/rsession-profile* configuration file with the below (you may need to create this file if it doesn't exist):

```bash
# /etc/rstudio/rsession-profile
ulimit -n 4096
```

It's worth noting that this file will need 755 permissions. You can run the following command to set this:

```bash
chmod 755 /etc/rstudio/rsession-profile
```

Save the above file, and then restart the Workbench and Launcher services:

```bash
sudo rstudio-server restart
```
```bash
sudo rstudio-launcher restart
```

Once the R session has restarted, you should now see this value in effect by running the following commands in the R terminal:


```R
system("ulimit -n")
```
###### OR
```R
system("ulimit -a")
```

Note that you may need to increase the *ulimit* value above to more than 4096 if you are still seeing the issue!
