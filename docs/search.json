The steps to install these drivers can be found here: https://docs.posit.co/pro-drivers/workbench-connect/\nYour best option is to isolate the product, and try to connect to your database natively from the command line. You can test connections by running isql, which is a command line tool for interactive SQL queries. To do so, you will need to create an odbc.ini file in the /etc directory.\nTo create a new DSN: 1. Edit the /etc/odbc.ini file. 2. Add a new entry for your desired database type by copying over the sample from /opt/rstudio-drivers/odbc.ini.sample. 3. Ensure that the Driver setting in the DSN refers to the corresponding driver name or path listed in /etc/odbcinst.ini. 4. Modify the entry with your desired connection parameters\nFor example, to add a SQL Server connection:"

To do so, you can set the following variables within your environment using the R terminal:\nSys.setenv(\n\"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\" = \"0000000\",\n\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\"= \"000000\",\n\"AWS_DEFAULT_REGION\" = \"us-west-2\",\n\"AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\" = \"0000000\")\nNote that the zeros used in the above are simply placeholders.
