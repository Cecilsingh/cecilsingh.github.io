You may wish to run Shiny apps natively via the command line to help isolate code-related issues when when working with Posit Workbench or Posit Connect. Running code natively via the command line can help identify if issues are within code or within the product. Rscript allows you to test shiny applications and run them via the R command line. The following documentation contains more information on this:

https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/Rscript

## Example Usage

First, let's create our Shiny Web Application. For this example, we will be using a single file application (app.R), however, multiple file web applications can be used (ui.R, and server.R). The file is located in /home/posit/testapp/app.R. The content of this application can be seen below:

```default
library(shiny)
# Global variables can go here
n <- 200


# Define the UI
ui <- bootstrapPage(
  numericInput('n', 'Number of Jobs', n),
  plotOutput('plot')
)


# Define the server code
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    hist(runif(input$n))
  })
}

# Return a Shiny app object
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
Once we have our application built, we can run this from the Linux command line using Rscript:

```default
Cecil@RStudio:~# R -e "shiny::runApp('/home/posit/testapp')"
```
This will run your code natively via the R command line:

```default
Cecil@PositWorkbench:~# R -e "shiny::runApp('/home/posit/testapp')"
