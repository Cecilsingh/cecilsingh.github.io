Posit Pro drivers allow you to easily connect your Workbench & Connect servers to external databases. The steps to install these drivers can be found here:
https://docs.posit.co/pro-drivers/workbench-connect/

Your best option is to isolate the product, and try to connect to your database natively from the command line. You can test connections by running *isql*, which is a command line tool for interactive SQL queries. To do so, you will need to create an *odbc.ini* file in the `/etc` directory. 

To create a new DSN:
1. Edit the `/etc/odbc.ini` file.
2. Add a new entry for your desired database type by copying over the sample from `/opt/rstudio-drivers/odbc.ini.sample`.
3. Ensure that the Driver setting in the DSN refers to the corresponding driver name or path listed in `/etc/odbcinst.ini`.
4. Modify the entry with your desired connection parameters

For example, to add a SQL Server connection:

## File: /etc/odbc.ini

```default
[test]
Driver = SQLServer
Server = my.server.name
Database = dbname
Port = 1433
```
To test this connection, run the following command in the Linux terminal:
```default
isql -v test
```
